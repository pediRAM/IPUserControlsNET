## **IRAN IS BLEEDING --- AND THE WORLD IS SILENT**
BEGIN OF UPDATE: 2026-01-18
LAST UPDATEL: 2026-02-18

# Massacre in IRAN
## The Media is Silent!
## BBC and CNN use the narative and political framing of the criminal Islamist Djihadist Mullah Regime of Iran
### 20 Mil. USD have been paid to influencers and PR companies in western countries to relativate, deny, negate and downsize the Crimes of Islamist Djihadist Republic of Iran
### The western Democracies are infiltraded by hundreds of NGOs and Consulting Institutions of Islamist Criminal Republic of Iran

[**The Slaughterer and Tyranny Regime of Mullahs is Slaughtering their protesting Nation and the Media was and is silent for a very long time!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x36HO4BiPYI)

This Regime has killed at least ~12000+~ 40000+ protestors in 48 hours (8th - 9th Jan. 2026),
after [turning off the internet](https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115979334965828202), Mobile-net, telephone-net and even electricity and they started to 
disturb the satellite frequencies by military jammers from china, to also [turn off the internet connection through Starlink](https://www.techpolicy.press/what-irans-internet-shutdown-reveals-about-starlink/)!

But some brave people which traveled to abroud smuggled a lot of images and videos, but also figures/statistics collected
by brave doctors in Iran. The figures/numbers currently after ~three~ six weeks of protesting are:
- Death toll: ~60000+~ 94000+ since 2026-01-18 until today 21th Feb. 2026 (secret services estimate numbers over 100000!)
- Blined: ~8000+~ 10000+
- Wounded: 350000+
- Detained: 130000+ (which is decreasing due to daily silent mass executions)

When the family of killed protestors try to get the dead body, [**they have to pay the "bullet-price" of 5000 to 7000 USD for each Bullet!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmPnGJG8yQw&t=935s)
An average worker earns about 100 to 200 USD per month!

**The bodies of those whose relatives cannot afford the bullet-price are buried in mass graves without names or any other identifying information or markings at unknown locations.**

Car and ferniture are also confiscated.

Scared from ***Final Shot*** of Regime-Thugs, [many wounded people are scared to go to hospitals or doctors](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx015nkplo), so they lie at home and ***die slowly due to Infections or Internal Bleedings***.

**Now(2026-01-18), after 120+ hours of internet-shuttdown, they turn it for some time on to transfere their BitCoins to wallets out of iran!**

The regime thugs [**invaded into hospitals by force and killed wounded people by final shot.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcxE5OX4TDo&t=74s)

The Doctors and Nurses, resisted against the regime thugs, have [**also been killed or detained with death sentence!**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx015nkplo)

## Thank you!
   
The whole work and code has been done by **[mariugul](https://github.com/mariugul)** and I want to thank him at this place, because without his great work and efforts, I would not be able to have a WPF library for .NET6, 8 and 9 so fast and easily by just migrating it. Great work! Well done! Thank you **[mariugul](https://github.com/mariugul)** !

This project stands as a testament to the collaborative spirit of the open-source community. I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the many talented individuals and teams whose hard work and dedication have paved the way for this endeavor. Without their pioneering efforts and the generous availability of their tools and libraries, this project would not have been possible.

Their commitment to sharing their work with the world has not only facilitated my contributions but has also enriched the broader development community. Thank you to all who have contributed to the open-source ecosystem, enabling projects like this to flourish.
